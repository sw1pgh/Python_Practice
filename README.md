# Python_Practice
This Repository contains all the codes that I will be learning and writing while learning python simultaneously. Along with this, it will also be containing any projects that I believe would make sense doing.

> Install modules using:
- pip install -r requirements.txt [Windows]  
or
- pip3 install -r requirements.txt [Mac]  

> Module: A module is a file containing code written by someone else(usually) which can be imported and used in our programs

> pip/pip3: It is the package manager for python. You can use pip/pip3 to install a module on your system

> Types of Modules:
- Built in Modules [Pre-installed in Python]
- External Modules [Need to be installed using pip/pip3]

> REPL = Read Evaluate Print Loop 
- Simply go to the terminal and type python/python3, it will open REPL to code

-> # Single Line Comment

-> ''' Multi Line Comment'''

> ERROR1: The error you're encountering suggests that Python is trying to use your script file named requests.py instead of the actual requests library. When you name your script the same as a module, it can lead to conflicts.

> A variable is a name given to a memory location in a program.
- variables: container to store a value
- keywords: reserved words in python and cannot be used to name a variable
- identifiers: class/function/variable name  

> Types of Data Types in Python:
- Integers
- Floating Point Numbers
- String
- Boolean
- None  

> Python is a fantastic language that automatically identifies the tyoe of data for us.  

> Rules of defining a variable name(also applies to other identifiers)
- A variable name CAN contain alphabets, digits and underscores
- A variable name CAN only start with an alphabet or underscore
- A variable name CANNOT start with a digit
- No white space is allowed to be used inside a variable name:
- Eg.: my_name, isNegative, integer_1, _integer2
