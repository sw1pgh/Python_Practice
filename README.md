# Python_Practice
This Repository contains all the codes that I will be learning and writing while learning python simultaneously. Along with this, it will also be containing any projects that I believe would make sense doing.

> Install modules using:
- pip install -r requirements.txt [Windows]  
or
- pip3 install -r requirements.txt [Mac]  

> Module: A module is a file containing code written by someone else(usually) which can be imported and used in our programs

> pip/pip3: It is the package manager for python. You can use pip/pip3 to install a module on your system

> Types of Modules:
- Built in Modules [Pre-installed in Python]
- External Modules [Need to be installed using pip/pip3]

> REPL = Read Evaluate Print Loop 
- Simply go to the terminal and type python/python3, it will open REPL to code

> ERROR1: The error you're encountering suggests that Python is trying to use your script file named requests.py instead of the actual requests library. When you name your script the same as a module, it can lead to conflicts.
